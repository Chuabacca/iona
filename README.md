## Inspiration & Purpose
This repository was inspired by Una Kravets' [personal-goals](https://github.com/una/personal-goals) repository. One of the hallmarks of a growing engineer/developer is habitual and consistent learning. I hope to catalogue the things I'm learning and track that process over time for myself with this repository. Have a look around and feel free to ask questions or make suggestions!
